I watched one Eater YouTube of a Los Angelino  freaking out about this burger and he needs to turn in his L.A. credentials pronto. He said \"people in L.A. would be lining up out the door\" - get real man. This is pretty flat flavored burger that in no way competes with LA fast food legends like In & Out and more classic artisan offering like the legendary Father's Office Korean-influenced sandwich. I had the classic beef burger and added a side of the bacon beef gravy because that sounded quite decadent, and I found everything to be of that classic British one dimensional deep beef n' onion style. Not bad mind you and perfectly serviceable but given the hype and recommendations around this place I was expecting way, way more. Bun was also pretty boring despite looking like a beautiful baked and buttered delight.It was good enough to come back and try other stuff but I won't rush to do so.</div><div style=\"flex: 2;\">2.0</div></div><div style=\"display: flex; align-items: center; text-align: center; padding: 15px;\"><div style=\"flex: 1;\">3</div><div style=\"flex: 4; max-width: 400px; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis;\">It was literally in a disguised pub in an alley way but I am glad I ran into it. Listen as a immediate burger connoisseur this was probably top 5 burgers I have ever had. The seating is pretty tight in there so be prepared to listen to other's conversations unintentionally lol. The service was just okay. Ordered the Beef Burger with Cheese. It has this onion relish on top that is to die for. The burger is juicy and beautifully cooked. Also appreciated that they have plant based options for my partners. The fries were perfect crispness and salted nicely. Everything else was a big drop off. The cider tasted very flat and the slaw had zero dressing.</div><div style=\"flex: 2;\">3.0</div></div><div style=\"display: flex; align-items: center; text-align: center; padding: 15px;\"><div style=\"flex: 1;\">4</div><div style=\"flex: 4; max-width: 400px; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis;\">They make GOOD burgers. All the flavors were melting in my mouth. The rosemary fries were also delectable. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and well salted. It's an awesome portion size and there were ketchup and mayo bottles on the table.

Honest burger (gluten-free bun, meat cooked medium-rare)         - Bun texture: best gluten-free bun I've ever had. Hands down         - Meat texture: cooked perfectly medium         - Chips: crunch level 3/5, but seasoned perfectly         - Seasoning: just right enough to add my own condiments if needed         - Portion: 1 burger was filling enough and there was more than enough fries to go around!    3. Kentucky Tea          - Perfect balance of lemonade and alcoholSERVICE:   - Friendly   - Understanding; we were seated before a group in front of us, and one of the girls said something in a different language. Little did she know, the host spoke the same language and called her out and said there was a table for 2 open when she was with a table of 3. Her ears turned red and she was apologetic. They were seated 5 minutes after us.EXTRA:   - This place is extremely small. I enjoyed sitting outside because it wasn't as loud. Although it was cramped in the corner, I never felt rushed and we enjoyed our time here   - Again, best gluten-free buns I've EVER hadWOULD RECOMMEND?   - Yes! I missed my chance to come here a few years ago and glad I had the chance this year. Will be back the next time I'm in London also!</div><div style=\"flex: 2;\">4.0</div></div><div style=\"display: flex; align-items: center; text-align: center; padding: 15px;\"><div style=\"flex: 1;\">9</div><div style=\"flex: 4; max-width: 400px; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis;\">Loved the burgers and fries so delicious we went twice on our 3 days trip in London!!!

When we asked there was a \"printer error\". I'm not sure how a printer managed to turn a 2, into a 1 but sure, sounds \"honest\". We asked for the rest of our order and were told 8-10 minutes. 20 minutes later we were still waiting. People were being served ahead of us, despite the wait, which is disgusting. Surely if you'd made a mistake you'd prioritise the mistake over everything else, wouldn't you? The only reason this gets two stars rather than one is because they offered our \"meal\" on the house. To be honest I wouldn't have paid for such terrible service anyway.We will not be eating here again. Severely disappointed, which is a shame as their Brighton restaurant was amazing.</div><div style=\"flex: 2;\">2.0</div></div>"
